        <p>Gabrielle Bonheur ‘Coco’ Chanel was a French fashion
            designer and businesswoman. The founder of the Chanel
            brand, she was credited in the post-World War I era
            with popularising a casual chic as the feminine
            standard of style. This replaced the ‘corseted
            silhouette’ that was dominant beforehand with a style
            that was simpler, far less time consuming to put on and
            remove, more comfortable, and less expensive, all
            without sacrificing elegance. She is the only fashion
            designer listed on Time magazine's list of the 100 most
            influential people of the 20th century.

        <p class="quote">'Fashion changes, but style endures.'</p>
        <p>A prolific fashion creator, Chanel extended her influence
            beyond couture clothing, realising her aesthetic design in
            jewellery, handbags, and fragrance. Her signature scent,
            Chanel No. 5, has become an iconic product, and Chanel
            herself designed her famed interlocked-CC monogram, which
            has been in use since the 1920s.

        <p>In the 1920s she introduced the Little Black Dress to
            fashion. Intended to be affordable and easy-to-wear.
            Vogue rightly predicted that it would be worn around the
            world.</p>

        <p>Chanel became very rich and famous during her life, but her childhood was a humble one. She was the daughter of a peasant and a street vendor and was born in a poorhouse.</p>
        <p class="quote">'There are people who have money and people who are rich.'</p>
        <p>Known all around the world as Coco Chanel, this wasn't
            her original name. Born Gabrielle Chanel, she became
            ‘Coco’ after being given the nickname by soldiers in
            the audience while singing on stage. It means something
            like  darling.</p>
        <p class="quote">'My life didn't please me, so I created one that did.'</p>
        <p>Coco Chanel was unapologetic in her choices. She was
            accused of being a collaborator during the war because
            she made circumstances work for her. There is no doubt
            she was highly resourceful.</p>
        <p class="quote">'I don't spend time beating on a wall, hoping
            to transform it into a door.'</p>
        <p>She demonstrated that you can have both elegance and practicality.
            Two qualities I value in my own work as a web designer.'</p>
        <p class="quote">'Some people think luxury is the opposite of poverty.
            It is not. It is the opposite of vulgarity.'</p>

            <p class="caption">Chanel bag</p>

        <p>She overturned traditional views about femininity.
            Championing what was by some called a ‘boyish’ look.</p>
        <p>As far as I can see she didn’t set out to ‘change the
            world’ but by sticking to her own style and vision -
            by creating her own life - she also became hugely
            influential and successful. For me, the latter is the
            icing on the cake. Being yourself … is the cake.</p>
        <p>On 10 January 1971, after returning from a walk with her friend,
            Coco died on her bed in the Hotel Ritz. Her last words to her
            maid Celine were:</p>
        <p class="quote">'You see, this is how you die.'</p>
